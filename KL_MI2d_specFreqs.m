%   USAGE:
%       [mod2d, phasepref2d] = KL_MI2d_specFreqs(dataLowF,dataHighF,flow,fhigh,flowBandPlusMinus,fhighBandPlusMinus,samplerate,plt); % 2d reflects that varying
%       both phase and amplitude frequencies
%
%   INPUTS:
%       dataLowF   = The unfiltered data (row vector) that will filter in
%       low frequencies
%       dataHighF = The unfiltered data (row vector) that will filter in
%       high frequencies (can be same or different signal (e.g. second
%       brain region) as dataLowF)
%       flow = row vector of low frequencies
%       fhigh = row vector of high frequencies
%       flowBandPlusMinus = frequency band around low frequencies (+/-; see flow1 and flow2, below)
%       fhighBandPlusMinus = frequency band around high frequencies (+/-; see fhigh1 and fhigh2, below)
%       samplerate = sampling rate
%       plt    = 'y' or 'n' to plot data
%
%   OUTPUTS:
%       A plot of the two-dimensional modulation index.
%       mod2d  = The two-dim modulation index.
%       phasepref2d = The two-dim phase preference
